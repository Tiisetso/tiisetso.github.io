Hi,

My name is Tiisetso Daniel Murray and this is my blog. 

I'm a South African living in Milan, Italy studying double masters degree in industrial engineering. I've lived in Beijing, China for two years where I started my degree got to know China and learn Mandarin.

Already in love with an ancient culture with incredible food that have become modern experts at making anything, I thought I would try be a citizen of the world again and live in another ancient culture with incredible food who are experts at designing anything. Seemed like a good pairing and if you think food is an important part of my decision process you'd be right! 

Prior to the above I've gained expeirence as an industrial engineer at a local low friction polymer manufacturer in South Africa that exports a homegrown worldclass product. I saw the inner workings of a medium sized enterprise from the factory floor all the way to the sales office.

I also taught physics and chemistry at a high school to all grades. I aimed to instil a love and appreciation for science and the world around us. No child left my classes without having seen the Saturn V rocket launch and being challenged to imagine worlds beyond ours and how little we know about the one we're on.

Those are just my professional roles. I've been a chef preparing and serving food for sale at Johannesburg's most trendy markets and private events, consulted on a 10 million page claims processing backlog for government, built a preventative maintenance system for steel rolling mills with MS Excel macros, designed and built electricity-free self watering plant systems for domestic homes, and designed a self harvesting mealworm farm as proof of concept for the mass production of insects to address future protein shortages.

These days you can find me going on week long fasts trying to self experiment my way to finding an antifragile method to extend my life, lose bodyfat, and still get to eat gelato. I believe fasting and drastically reducing carbohydrate cosnnumption is the panacea to our modern health problems. I'm developing a videogame on the side because it's fun but also because I believe things that are commonly known in videogame design are potentially ground breaking in other fields, especially where systems of humans are involved. You'll find me complaining about antiquated South African banking services (I'm looking at you FNB) to anyone South African who'll listen, I'm so frustrated I'm learning about UX design just so I can complain with references.

I love learning. I love understanding how things work and why they work. What we do is so much less interesting than why we do it. I love problems, I love iterating through solutions, I love constraints that demand we reach for solutions that are elegant and often seem obvious once found. I listen to podcasts like Radiolab, Revisionist History, Planet Money, London School of Economics, Social Science Bites, Tim Ferriss, Farnam Street Knowledge Project, and Dissect (yes, the one about hip hop and rap music)in my inbetween moments.

If you want to hire me, you can find my [CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/CV - Tiisetso Murray.pdf) here. I can work in Europe until Sep 2019 in person but I can work for anyone anywhere remotely.
