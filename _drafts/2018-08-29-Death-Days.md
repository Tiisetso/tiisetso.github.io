I can easily think of the birthdays of friends and family but only death day. We celebrate birthdays to celebrate the people we care about. But when someone dies what do we do about that date?

I think someone close to you has to die before you think about the date that they died. I'm in my late twenties now and my social media accounts are filled with people approximately my age. Spending even a little time on social media makes you realise that it is always somebody's birthday. but occasionally a post appears in memory of a loved one.

I think their frequency will increase as people age and so do their parents. People in their twenties naturally have parents in 50's give or take ten years. We only live for so long. Having lost a parent in my early twenties I'm acutely aware of the significance of the day. 

I remember where I was. What I did. How I felt. the jarring sensation of being instantly whipped out of one reality and thrown into adjacent one. Now only able to look back at what once was frozen in fading memories of memories. 

The day, when it comes around feel like my own personal new year. A BC and an AD just for me. But the day itself is harmless. After all, you can only die once. Losing a loved one needs no reminder but anniversary of a death is a strong one. 

I use the day to remember my father of course. I like to remember what he enjoyed and try to enjoy those things to. For my him it was ice cream and coffee. Both in far from sensible amounts. It's a ritual for my siblings and I to enjoy both and send pictures. 

We need more death days. Birthdays give us people. Death days remind us of what the people gave us. I'd like to see them celebrated more. I'd like for others to share their death day rituals too.
